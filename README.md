# Refactoring Hub-like and Cyclic Dependency Code Smells in Java

This repository demonstrates common **object-oriented code smells**—specifically **Hub-like dependencies** and **Cyclic dependencies**—in Java, along with refactored solutions following clean code and design principles.

## 🔍 Code Smells Overview

### Cyclic Dependency
When classes depend on each other in a circular way, making the code harder to test and maintain.

### Hub-like Dependency
When one class is connected to many others, becoming a central point that can easily break the system if changed.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java (JDK 17 or newer)
- **Tools:** Any IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse), or command-line

---

## How to Run

You can run the code using an IDE or from the terminal.

### Terminal Example

```bash
# Go to the refactored solution folder
cd HubLike/src/solutions

# Compile the Java files
javac *.java

# Run the main class
java Main  # Replace 'Main' with the actual main class name if needed
